This is the PHPUnit Test suite for the simpleWorkflow Yii extension.

To install, just replace the existing protected/tests folder with this one. Before being
able to run the tests be sure to :

* Configure a DB connection
* Create the 'item' table by running the tests/models/create.sql SQL script
* Check that relative path defined in bootstrap.php match your environment settings
